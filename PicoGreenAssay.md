**Things to know before you get started**

* This method is a reduced volume protocol using only **100 uL reactions** and requiring only **1 uL of sample**.
* PicoGreen Reagent is a solid while in the fridge and **will need at least 20-30 min** on the benchtop to thaw.
* The example tables provided may need to be scaled up if you are quantifying many samples. You will need to adjust these amounts up if you are running many samples.
* Remember that the first row of each plate you read will need to have your standards (i.e. if you have a full 96 sample plate to quantify you will need to spread it over 2 plates on the reader)
* The protocol has three steps:
  * Step 1 - Create new working stocks for the diluted picogreen reagent and a new serial dilution of the stock ladder (this will be needed for your standards).
  * Step 2 - Setup the reactions.
  * Step 3 - Running plate on plate reader.


### Step 1 - Making Working Stocks and creating standard dilutions

  **1X TE**

| Reagent | Volume |
|:-------:|:------:|
| 20xTE (ml) | 1.25 |
| H20(ml) | 23.75 |
| Total Volume (ml) | 25 |

**Diluted Picogreen**

  * PicoGreen should be diluted 1:200.
  * This is something you should make as needed, and the amount of diluted PicoGreen should be made on the day.

Example (this will need to scaled up depending on the number of samples you are processing)

| Reagent | Volume |
|:-------:|:------:|
| PicoGreen (ul) | 1 |
| 1XTE (ul) | 199 |
| Total Volume (ml) | 200 |

**Serial Ladder Dilution**

  * These three ladder diluations are needed to make the sixe standards.
  
Serial Dilution Standard Table 

| Ladder| Reagent | Volume (ul) | Volume 1X TE (ul) | Total Volume (ul) | 
|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Ladder Dilution 1 | Stock Ladder | 1 | 49 | 50 |
| Ladder Dilution 2 | Dilution 1 | 5 | 45 | 50 |
| Ladder Dilution 3 | Dilution 2 | 5 | 45 | 50 |

### Step 2 - Setting up a reaction and loading plate

**Standards (for a single plate)**

* Six 50 ul standards are created for using the ladders created in step 1, by combining ladder, TE and Diluted PicoGreen in the volumes outlines in the table below.
* The reactions should be made directly in the black 96 well plate within the first column (I usually put them in rows 2-7, beginning with the most concentrated and ending with the blank)
* The final addition of PicoGreen is pipetted up multiple times to mix the reaction.

| Standard_ID | Conc. (ng/ml) | Ladder Dilultion | Ladder Volume (ul) | 1X TE Volume (ul) | Diluted PicoGreen Volume (ul) | 
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| 1 | 250 | Ladder Dilution 1 (2ug/ml) | 12.5 | 37.5 | 50 |
| 2 | 50 | Ladder Dilution 1 (2ug/ml) | 5 | 45 | 50 |
| 3 | 10 | Ladder Dilution 2 (0.2ug/ml) | 5 | 45 | 50 | 
| 4 | 4 | Ladder Dilution 2 (0.2ug/ml) | 2 | 48  | 50 | 
| 5 | 1 | Ladder Dilution 3 (0.02ug/ml) | 5 | 45 | 50 |
| 6 | blank | blank | blank | 50 | 50 |

**Note** -  The volumes for each ladder dilution is sufficient for running 2 separate plates. You will need to increase those quantities if you plan on running more than 2 plates worth of samples.
